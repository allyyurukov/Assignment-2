# Assignment-2
This program adds journaling capabilities to the basic file management system created in Assignment 1. Text files store journal entries that users can create, read, edit and manage. This application employs a custom file format (.dsu) and JSON for data serialization. It has new journal files with user profiles (username, password, bio), existing journal files loaded and managed, journal entries added, edited or deleted and journal contents printed alongside user profiles. Run `a2.py` to begin the program. At the prompt select either ‘admin’ mode or ‘user’ mode: In ‘admin’ mode use command line syntax for operations. In ‘user’ mode follow on screen prompts for more guided experience. a2.py: This is the main entry point into our program. ui.py: It handles the interaction with the user interface. profile_manager.py: This class is in charge of managing profile tables and reducing them to posts. file_handler.py: It deals with issues of file. Written in Python, this program conforms to PEP 8 coding standards. It is also developed into modules for maintainability and includes error handling for robustness across the board.
